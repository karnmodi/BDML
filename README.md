# Big Data and Machine Learning Coursework

This repository contains the coursework submissions for the **Big Data and Machine Learning** module (CTEC3702) at **De Montfort University**. It showcases data exploration, visualization, and machine learning solutions implemented using **Apache Spark MLlib** and Python.

## Project Overview

The coursework is divided into two main parts:
1. **Part A**: Data Exploration and Visualization  
   Focuses on analyzing large datasets, cleaning data, and visualizing insights to identify patterns and trends.

2. **Part B**: Machine Learning Problem Solutions  
   Implements machine learning algorithms using **Apache Spark MLlib**, covering tasks like classification, regression, and model evaluation.
